- name: Personalized POI Auto-completion System at Baidu Maps
  role: Tech lead (CTO Award in 2019 at Baidu Inc.)
  description: Point of interest auto-completion (POI-AC) is a featured function in the search engine of many Web mapping services. This function keeps suggesting a dynamic list of POIs as a user types each character, and it can dramatically save the effort of typing, which is quite useful on mobile devices. Personalized POI-AC contains our 3 attempts on taking historically clicked POIs, the prefixes and spatial-temporal features of a user into account for personalization. So far, personalized POI-AC serves nearly 80% users (tens of millions of users) at Baidu Maps everyday, saving 30% efforts on typing.

- name: Towards Automatic Verification of Large-scale POIs with Street Views at Baidu Maps
  role: Tech lead (CTO Award in 2020 at Baidu Inc.)
  description: To save the tremendous labor costs on volunteered geographic information (VGI) platforms, we devised an automatic system for large-scale POI verification with the multimodal street-view data at Baidu Maps. It mainly relies on a highly efficient framework to accelerate POI verification by means of deep multimodal embedding and approximate nearest neighbor (ANN) search. Compared with VGI, it can significantly increase the throughput of POI verification by 50 times, dramatically improving the productivity and efficiency of POI verification at Baidu Maps. As of December 2021, it has made over 405 million times of POI verification within a 3.5-year period, representing an approximate workload of 800 high-performance expert mappers.
