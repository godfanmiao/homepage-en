- name: Personalized POI Auto-completion System
  role: Tech lead (CTO Award in 2019 at Baidu Inc.)
  description: Point of interest auto-completion (POI-AC) is a featured function in the search engine of many Web mapping services. This function keeps suggesting a dynamic list of POIs as a user types each character, and it can dramatically save the effort of typing, which is quite useful on mobile devices. Personalized POI-AC contains our 3 attempts on taking historically clicked POIs, the prefixes and spatial-temporal features of a user into account for personalization. So far, personalized POI-AC serves nearly 80% users (tens of millions of users) at Baidu Maps everyday, saving 30% efforts on typing.

- name: Towards Automatic Verification of Large-scale POIs with Street Views
  role: Tech lead (CTO Award in 2020 at Baidu Inc.)
  description: To save the tremendous labor costs on volunteered geographic information (VGI) platforms, we devised an automatic system for large-scale POI verification with the multimodal street-view data at Baidu Maps. It mainly relies on a highly efficient framework to accelerate POI verification by means of deep multimodal embedding and approximate nearest neighbor (ANN) search. Compared with VGI, it can significantly increase the throughput of POI verification by 50 times, dramatically improving the productivity and efficiency of POI verification at Baidu Maps. As of December 2021, it has made over 405 million times of POI verification within a 3.5-year period, representing an approximate workload of 800 high-performance expert mappers.

- name: Multi-modal Sensor Fusion, Object Tracking and Prediction for Autonomous Driving 
  role: Tech lead & Manager at Momenta
  description: Reliable detection and tracking of surrounding objects are indispensable for comprehensive motion prediction and planning of autonomous vehicles. Due to the limitations of individual sensors, the fusion of multiple sensor modalities is required to improve the overall detection capabilities. Additionally, robust motion tracking is essential for reducing the effect of sensor noise and improving state estimation accuracy. We build an end-to-end transformer for fusion, object tracking and trajectory prediction, which has been deployed at IM L7 for CP, HNP, UNP and PNP.

- name: Neural HD Map Construction Online by Vehicle-mounted Cameras 
  role: Tech lead & Manager at Navinfo Co., Ltd.
  description: High-definition (HD) map is a fundamental component of autonomous driving systems, as it can provide precise environmental information about driving scenes. Recent work on vectorized map generation could produce merely 65% local map elements around the ego-vehicle at runtime by one tour with onboard sensors, leaving a puzzle of how to construct a global HD map projected in the world coordinate system under high-quality standards. To address the issue, we build an end-to-end generative neural network to automatically construct HD maps with multiple vectorized tiles which are locally produced by autonomous vehicles through several tours. It leverages a multi-layer and attention-based autoencoder as the shared network, of which parameters are learned from two different tasks (i.e., pretraining and finetuning, respectively) to ensure both the completeness of generated maps and the correctness of element categories. It can surpass the SOTA method by more than 5% F1 score, reaching the level of industrial usage with a small amount of manual modification. We have already deployed it at Navinfo Co., Ltd., serving as an indispensable software to automatically build HD maps for autonomous driving systems.
