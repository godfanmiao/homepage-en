  description: CTO Award in 2019 at Baidu Inc. Point of interest auto-completion (POI-AC) is a featured function in the search engine of many Web mapping services. This function keeps suggesting a dynamic list of POIs as a user types each character, and it can dramatically save the effort of typing, which is quite useful on mobile devices. Personalized POI-AC contains our 3 attempts on taking historically clicked POIs, the prefixes and spatial-temporal features of a user into account for personalization. So far, personalized POI-AC serves nearly 80% users (tens of millions of users) at Baidu Maps everyday, saving 30% efforts on typing.
